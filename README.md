## **Overview and Orgin**

Venmo was incorporated in 2009. 
The founders of Venmo were Andrew Kortina and Iqram Magdon-Ismail.

This company came about because two friends wanted to enhance the current software that a friend was using at their Frozen Yogurt store.They felt that it was inadequate with its traditional approach for the exchange of currency. This prompted them to create their first prototype for sending cash via a text message before they created the smartphone app, Venmo. 

Overtime as they redesgined and revised their models, they gained interest of larger investors, such as Paypal, who finacially supported further advancements to the app. 

This app was targeted for the younger population intially, specifically for college students splitting checks for movies, dinner, rent, etc. This is referred to as the Peer-To-Peer Market. Currently Venmo also offers more services due to its partnership with Mastercard. This now can involve businesses to set up instant payments without using physical currency. 

## **Funding**  

-In May 2010, the company raised $1.2 million in a financing round led by RRE Ventures.

-In 2012, the company was acquired by Braintree for $26.2 million.

-In December 2013, PayPal acquired Braintree for $800 million.

## **Business Activities**

Instantaneous Cashless Handling is the issue that Venmo continues to target to solve for our society.

## **Results**

Venmo has had a major business impact. It gives millenials and business owners the opportunity to use a simple and intuitive interface in money exhcange. Small businesses such as decorators and owners renting out properties utilize Venmo. It helped open up networks to trend towards a _Cashless Economy._

Some of the major metrics that Venmo focuses on are its revenue, number of users, and security. Overall, Venmo is doing well, but there needs to be more focus on security. 

## **Recommendations**

Primarly, I would recommend that the company focuses on the security of payments during tranactions and advertises this security. Although, just like other platforms Venmo uses data encryptions, publically there have been many discussions of its security. One of the differences between Zelle and Venmo is that Zelle is a bank-backed application. One of the benefits of Venmo is that it is backed by PayPal which has been trusted in the market for 20+ years. Due to Zelle being bank-based, it tends to gain trust from users quicker than Venmo.
